## 📖 Project Summary
**GroupGainz** is a mobile application designed to tackle fitness motivation and accountability. It connects users with similar health and fitness goals into groups that commit to a shared workout agreement.  

At the core is a system of **peer accountability**, where users encourage each other to stay consistent. To add extra motivation, the platform offers an **optional financial wagering system**, letting users bet on their ability to stick to the plan.  

In addition to accountability features, GroupGainz also supports users by:
- 📊 Tracking health and fitness metrics  
- 🤖 Providing fitness support and guidance via an integrated AI  

The philosophy: **social pressure + group support = a powerful antidote to failed fitness resolutions.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem
Many people struggle to start or maintain workout routines due to:
- Lack of accountability  
- Fear of working out alone  

As a result, most fitness resolutions fail within the first month.  

---

## 💡 The Solution
GroupGainz makes a bold bet: **strangers will pay to hold each other accountable.**  
By leveraging social commitment, the app helps boost gym attendance and success rates.  

> Studies show joining a fitness group can dramatically increase workout consistency.

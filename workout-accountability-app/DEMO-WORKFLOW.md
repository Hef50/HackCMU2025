## **Key Talking Points**

### **Opening Hook (5 seconds)**
*"GroupGainz solves the biggest problem with workout groups - people flaking out. We use gamification, social pressure, and AI to keep everyone accountable."*

### **Core Value Props (10 seconds each)**

**1. Geolocation Check-ins**
*"No more fake check-ins. Our geolocation system ensures members are actually at the gym when they check in."*

**2. Photo Evidence**
*"After check-ins, members can add workout photos. Others can give kudos, creating positive social reinforcement."*

**3. AI Accountability**
*"Every Sunday, our AI reviews the week. Members who don't meet their point threshold get a funny roast message - it's accountability with humor."*

**4. Group Management**
*"Admins can pause contracts for breaks, schedule events, and manage members. Everything is designed for real-world group dynamics."*
